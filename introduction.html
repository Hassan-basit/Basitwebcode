<P>when linking CSS or any file to your html page we use the link tag and then href to specify the URL of your link source, In the image above (stylesheet.css) is a file so i use the href tag to specify it i.e stylesheet.css is the file i want to link to my HTML. </P>
<h2>FLEXBOX</h2>

<p>FLEXBOX is also a property of both HTML and CSS, The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending on viewport size. As you see in the image above it as an id named(flexbox-demo-bg) that will be use as an id in styling CSS and a class name (flex-container) that will also be use to show refrence to what you are styling on in CSS same happens to your flex items.</p>
<h3>CSS FLEXBOX PROPERTIES</h3>
